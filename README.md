# Cyclomatic Complexity Analyzer

Cyclomatic Complexity Analyzer is a project for analyzing the Cyclomatic Complexity Number. 

Cyclomatic Complexity is a software metric that is used to indicate the complexity of the program. 

Through this project, we will gather information through analyzing various public projects on Github,
and identify part of the code that impacts the Cyclomatic Complexity Number the most.
